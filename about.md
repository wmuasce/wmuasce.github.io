# About Us

## Who We Are
We are the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Associated General Contractors (AGC), and Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Student Chapters at Western Michigan University (WMU).
## What We Do
The student chapter holds bi-weekly meetings at the WMU Engineering College. We participate Adopt-A-Highway and community outreach programs, host speakers, take field trips, and build the concrete canoe and steel bridge.

We are open to all students and encourage everyone to get involved. See how you can get involved.
